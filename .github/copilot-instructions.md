## Before you open a pull request

Measured across 131 merged PRs in this lab: **15% were self-declared `[WIP]` or
no-ops**. Each one still cost a full 10–30 minute agent run, and agent runs are
the single largest line in the lab's CI bill — around 63% of the monthly
allowance. A PR that says it isn't finished is the most expensive possible way to
report that you couldn't finish.

So: do not open a pull request unless all three of these are true.

**1. You changed behaviour.**
A change that only adds comments, reformats code, or restates the issue is not a
fix. If you discover the work is already done, **say so in a comment on the issue
and stop** — do not open a PR titled `No-op: already implemented`. The comment is
the useful artifact; the PR is noise that a human then has to close.

**2. You finished.**
Never open a PR titled `[WIP]`, `[Draft]`, or `Partial`. If something blocks you,
comment on the issue with: what you were trying to do, what you tried, the exact
error or ambiguity that stopped you, and what decision you need from a human.
That comment is worth more than a half-finished branch and costs a fraction as
much to act on.

**3. You verified it, and you say how.**
The PR description must state what you ran and what it printed. "Should work" and
"this should fix the issue" are not verification.

- If the repo has tests, add one that **fails without your change**. A test that
  passes either way certifies the implementation, not the requirement.
- If the change is not testable, say plainly what you checked by hand.
- If you could not verify it, say that too, in the description, rather than
  leaving it implied.

**Write the description properly.** It is the only part of your work that reaches
a human on a phone screen, and the merge gate refuses PRs whose body is empty or
boilerplate. Say what was broken, what you changed, and how you know it works.
